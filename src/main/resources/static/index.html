    <h1>Welcome to the Maze Runner Challenge</h1>
</div>
<div class="d-grid gap-3">
    <div class="p-2">
        You have been dropped in a maze of unknown size and must find the exit. The maze is laid out in a grid pattern. You
        will always start in the Northeast corner of the maze (position 0,0 of a grid). Your goal is to map the shortest
        path through the maze by collecting directional coordinates at each step. You will take a step by calling one of
        four methods on the MazeMaster object:
    </div>
    <div class="p-w">
        <ul>
            <li>stepNorth() (North is at the top of the grid)</li>
            <li>stepSouth() (South is at the bottom of the grid)</li>
            <li>stepEast() (If you can't figure out where East is now, don't start this challenge.)</li>
            <li>stepWest() (See the directions for East.)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="p-2">
        Each method will return a String indicating "Wall" or "Open Space" or "Exit". If you have hit a wall, you do not move.
        If you hit an open space, you have moved to that space. If you hit "Exit" you are done. Your solution should return a
        comma delimited string of your steps (e.g. N,S,E,W,W,E,N).
    </div>
    <div class="p-2">
        Things to consider:
        <ol>
            <li>The exit can be anywhere in the grid. Even the middle.</li>
            <li>The grid is not necessarily a square. (Could be a rectangle. Won't be a triangle or a circle.)</li>
            <li>In your workspace, you can either implement your own functional MazeMaster, or just mock it out. Only submit your
                implementation for runTheMaze().
            </li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="p-2">
        Example:
        <ul>
            <li>stepNorth() -> "Wall"</li>
            <li>stepEast() -> "Open Space"</li>
            <li>stepEast() -> "Open Space"</li>
            <li>stepEast() -> "Wall" // note: you did not move</li>
            <li>stepSouth() -> "Exit"</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="p-2">
        Your output should be "E,E,S" as the shortest path.
