    <h1>Welcome to the Maze Runner Challenge</h1>
</div>
<div class="d-grid gap-3">
    <div class="p-2">
        You have been dropped in a maze of unknown size and must find the exit. The maze is laid out in a grid pattern. You will
        always start in the NorthWest corner of the maze (position 0,0 of the grid). Your goal is to map the shortest path
        through the maze by sending directional coordinates for each step. You will take steps by passing in an array of
        Strings, where each item in the array is one of 4 cardinal directions (N, S, E, W), or 4 ordinal directions (NE, SE, SW, NW).
    </div>
    <div class="p-2">
        At maze 9 you will encounter stairs to other levels. To climb up stairs, you send 'U', to climb down stairs, you send 'D'. You will also start
        encountering coins. Find as many coins as possible before exiting.
    </div>
    <div class="p-w">
        <ul>
            <li>N will take 1 step towards the top of the grid.</li>
            <li>S will take 1 step towards the bottom of the grid.</li>
            <li>E will... (If you can't figure out where East is now, don't start this challenge.)</li>
            <li>W (See the directions for East.)</li>
            <li>NE will take you diagonally 1 step towards the top of the grid and 1 step right. This can technically squeeze between wall corners.
            </li>
            <li>SE will take you diagonally 1 step towards the bottom of the grid and 1 step right.</li>
            <li>SW will take you diagonally 1 step towards the bottom of the grid and 1 step left.</li>
            <li>NW will take you diagonally 1 step towards the top of the grid and 1 step left.</li>
            <li>U will walk you up stairs to the next upper level.</li>
            <li>D will walk you donw stairs to the next lower level</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="p-2">
        Each set of directions will return a String indicating you have hit a "Wall" or "Open Space" or "Exit" or a coin. If you hit an
        open space or a coin you have moved to that space. If you hit the coin, you have collected it. No separate command is necessary.
        If you hit "Exit" you are done, and you will receive a success message with your Secret Code.

        There are 9 levels to this maze (1, 2, 3 ... 9).
        </br></br>You may submit your solution to each level as you find it. Please submit your complete list of
        directions plus your secret code for each maze.

        Things to consider:
        <ol>
            <li>The exit can be anywhere in the grid. Even the middle.</li>
            <li>The grid is not necessarily a square.</li>
            <li>You can use Postman or SoapUI to test submissions and responses.</li>
            <li>When you climb up or down stairs, you will not necessarily be at position (0, 0) on the new level.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="p-2">
        Good luck!
